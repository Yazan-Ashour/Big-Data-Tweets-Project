# Real-Time Tweet Stream Processing and Visualization

# Project Overview:

This project involves designing and implementing a complete data pipeline to handle streaming tweets, process them, and visualize the results in a web application. The pipeline includes real-time tweet ingestion, sentiment analysis, hashtag extraction, storage, and visualization of tweets on a map with trend analysis. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface to interact with the tweet data and gain insights from various aspects, including tweet sentiment, hashtags, and temporal trends.

# Key Features:

1- Real-time Streaming: Continuous tweet stream ingestion from Twitter API or a simulated generator.

2- Data Storage: Processed tweets stored in Elasticsearch for easy querying and analysis.

3- Tweet Processing: Extraction of hashtags, sentiment analysis, and geolocation.

4- Visualization: A web application that allows users to search tweets by keyword, display them on a map, visualize trends over time, and analyze sentiment.
